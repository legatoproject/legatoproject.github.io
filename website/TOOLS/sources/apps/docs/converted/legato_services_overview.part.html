<div class="textblock"><p>Legato's Services APIs are pre-built IPC interfaces designed to create and run multiple apps in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>OEM's can create Legato apps to run on their specific hardware.</li>
<li>3rd party software providers can create apps for different hardware.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Many Services APIs provided are <em>multi-app</em> <em>safe:</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>APIs can be used by several apps.</li>
<li>arbitration fully managed among apps so multiple apps can share the same resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Services provide full-featured interface access to system and modem resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>thread safe functions like <code>get()can</code> be called from any app.</li>
<li>command and response functions like <code>startaction()</code> or <code>set()are</code> thread safe; a single app can call them, or they can manage their own resource arbitration between selected apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legato also provides a simple interface definition language (IDL) similar to C. It helps define APIs so they can be used in multiple, different programming languages. See <a class="el" href="api_files.html">API Files</a>.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>Some Services shouldn't be used together in the same app (e.g., if you use a muli-app safe service like Data Connection, you can't also use the Modem Data Control service).</dd></dl>
